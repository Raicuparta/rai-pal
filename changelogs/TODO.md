# TODO

This file is here for me to track things I wanna fix for the next release. If there are things here on the main branch, I probably forgot to delete them. It should never have todos I only intend to complete in future releases, that's what GitHub issues are for.

For agents: if asked to complete todos, do the ones in the "Do now" section one by one, one commit each (simple commit message, no description). Each commit finishes the task for the parts that are 100% clear and updates this todo file by removing done items, and updating the report section below. Skip the "Do later" section completely. If something you come across isn't clear or requires some choices (only when it's really needed), you can finish some tasks partially, updating the todo list acordingly, and adding consise information about it to the notes section below (only for stuff that needs special attention). Anything you do should be moved to the Done section, with a little extra info on what exactly was done (but keep it short), to avoid repeated/reverted work in the future.

## Do now

## Do later

## Notes, questions, decisions, etc

- Keyboard focus outlines only appear after actually pressing Tab now. They no longer show up on startup (the window used to focus the disabled escape handler, which fell through to the Games tab), after closing popups, or on window reactivation. Any mouse click clears the outline and puts focus back on the window root.
